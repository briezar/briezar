## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, Iâ€™m Viet, also go by the name Briezar

# ðŸŽ® My longtime aspiration is to be a Game Developer
Although I would consider myself a freshman in the coding university, I've expressed my interest in coding since a long while back.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently attending a Game Development course at Green IT Academy.
- ðŸŽˆ Iâ€™m looking to score a job in the gaming industry, preferably a Game Dev. It would also be nice to start off as an intern.
- ðŸ“« I've not worked at a Gaming Company before but I do have a large knowledge pool of all the games I play.
- ðŸ–± Fun fact: I used to make Warcraft III custom maps for me and my friend to play.
