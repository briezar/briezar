## 👋 Hi there, I’m Viet, also go by the name Briezar

# 🎮 My longtime aspiration is to be a Game Developer
Although I would consider myself a freshman in the coding university, I've expressed my interest in coding since a long while back.

- 🌱 I’m currently attending a Game Designer course at Green IT Academy.
- 🐢 I'm familiar with Git and Tortoise Git but have not worked as a team before.
- 🎈 I’m looking to score a job in the gaming industry, preferably a Game Dev. It would also be nice to start off as an intern.
- 📫 I've not worked at a Gaming Company before but I do have a large knowledge pool of all the games I've played.
- 🖱 Fun fact: I used to make Warcraft III custom maps for me and my friend to play.
